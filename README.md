# Informational Double Descent Research

Welcome to the Informational Double Descent Research repository. This project aims to explore the intersection of "grokking" (double descent phenomena) in machine learning models and information plane analysis, as originally introduced by Naftali Tishby. Our goal is to deepen the understanding of how learning dynamics and information processing evolve across training phases in various models.

## Project Overview

The concept of "double descent" describes a counterintuitive phenomenon where increasing model complexity past the point of interpolation can lead to improved performance. In parallel, the information plane analysis explores how layers in a neural network compress and fit data throughout training. This project aims to investigate whether a unified perspective can provide new insights into neural network training and generalization.


### Installation

Clone the repository and install the required Python packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HugoFry/Info_double_descent.git
